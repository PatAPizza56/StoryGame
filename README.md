## About

This project was created to gain experience in using JSON with c#. I am using Newtonsoft for JSON Parsing. Story Game allows you to create text-based storys, where a user can make decisions which will impact future gameplay. You create your story in a JSON file, and add the Path to the "Story Reader" object's constructor'
